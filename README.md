This is a simple chat server that integrates with XDI personal clouds.
It allows parents to manage chat connections of their children.

Sample deployment: http://chatapi.respectnetwork.net:3080/

### How to build

First, [XDI2](http://github.com/projectdanube/xdi2) needs to be build.

For now, use the snapshot-0.7-pre-no-value-node branch.

After that, just run

    mvn clean install

To build all components.

### How to run

	mvn jetty:run

Then go to:

	http://localhost:3080/

	HTTP POST:  http://localhost:3080/1/block?parent=...&parentSecretToken=...&child1=...&child2=...
	
	This is called by a parent to "block" a connection between child1 and child2.
	This ends all currently open chat sessions between child1 and child2.
	The connection between child1 and child2 still exists, but no new chat session
	can be started, until the connection gets "unblocked" again.
	
	Example response:
	
	(none)
	
---

	HTTP POST:  http://localhost:3080/1/unblock?parent=...&parentSecretToken=...&child1=...&child2=...
	
	This is called by a parent to "unblock" a connection between child1 and child2.
	After that, new chat sessions can be opened again.
	If the connection has been blocked by parents of both child1 and child2, then it
	also has to be unblocked again by both sides.
	
	Example response:
	
	(none)
	
---

	HTTP POST:  http://localhost:3080/1/delete?parent=...&parentSecretToken=...&child1=...&child2=...
	
	This is called by a parent to "delete" a connection between child1 and child2.
	This ends all currently open chat sessions between child1 and child2.
	After that, a connection has to be re-created from start, using the "request" and
	"approve" API calls.
	
	Example response:
	
	(none)
	
---

	WebSocket:  ws://localhost:3080/1/chat/{child1}/{child2}?child1SecretToken=...
	
	This is a WebSocket endpoint that provides actual chat sessions. The chat session
	has to be opened from both ends. For example, if child1 and child2 want to chat, they
	would open the following WebSocket URLs, respectively:
	ws://localhost:3080/1/chat/child1/child2?child1SecretToken=...
	ws://localhost:3080/1/chat/child2/child1?child2SecretToken=...
	During the WebSocket protocol handshake, the sub-protocol "cynja-chat" is used.

#### Parameters:

	child1 ... Child 1's cloud name or cloud number
	child2 ... Child 2's cloud name or cloud number
	parent ... The parent's cloud name or cloud number
	child1SecretToken ... Child 1's secret token (password)
	parentSecretToken ... The parent's secret token (password)
